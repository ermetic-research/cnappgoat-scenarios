  description: The scenario in question facilitates the creation of a new Lambda function
    in AWS, with secrets embedded within the function's environment variables. This
    practice raises a security risk as the secrets, such as passwords or API keys,
    may be exposed or exploited. To mitigate the risk, it is recommended these secrets
    be stored in a secure way such as AWS Secrets Manager or using environment variables.
    This approach allows secrets to be decoupled from the code, enhancing security
    and simplifying the management of secrets.
