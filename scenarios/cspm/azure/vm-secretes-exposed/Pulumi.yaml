  description: The scenario creates a new Azure VM instance using Pulumi, with sensitive
    information ("mysecretpassword1231") in the custom data. The issue is that placing
    secrets in the custom data presents a major security risk, as this data is not encrypted
    and can be easily accessed. To solve the problem, secrets should be stored securely
    using Azure Key Vault, allowing the VM to retrieve them securely when needed.
