  description: This scenario involves deploying an Azure storage account with public network access. By default, when you create a new storage account, the network is open to the internet.
    The storage account still restricts access to blob containers, file shares, tables and queues by requiring Azure Active Directory authentication and access policy permissions.
    For greater security, firewall rules should restrict access to specific IP addresses and virtual networks.
