  description: This scenario involves deploying an Azure Key Vault with a key that does not have an expiration date. 
      Ensure that your key vault keys have an expiration date to prevent the immediate loss of data/security functions supported by key vault objects in case of accidental deletion (for example, authentication, validation, verification, non-repudiation, etc.).
      To make your key vault keys recoverable, set an expiration date.
