  description: This scenario involves deploying an Azure Key Vault with delete protection disabled. 
    Ensure that your key vault is recoverable to prevent the immediate loss of data/security functions supported by key vault objects in case of accidental deletion (for example, authentication, validation, verification, non-repudiation, etc.).
    To make your key vault recoverable, enable the "Soft Delete" and "Do Not Purge" functions.
